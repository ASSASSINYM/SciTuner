SciTuner
========

SciTuner is guitar tuner with real-time signal visualization.
The application uses strong digital processing algorithm for accurate frequency estimation and wave visualization.
SciTuner presents many useful features:

• Works with guitars, ukuleles, banjos, violins and some other instruments
• Allows to see a wave form of a sound in real time
• Suppresses false harmonics in filter mode (on by default)
• Allows to tune on 5th, 7th and 12th frets for fine tune
• Makes frequency estimation with precision ±0,1Hz
• Allows to freeze the wave form and values by button "pause"
• Works in noisy conditions
